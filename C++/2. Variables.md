# Variables

## 2.1 Introduction
Variable are essential to any programming language are variables. In C++, all 
variables are declared in the same format: 

```
<variable type> <variable name> = <variable value> ;
```

This basically tells the compiler the type of the variable, the way we will 
reference the variable, and what the value the variable will have. One can 
leave a variable unitialized like so:

```
<variable type> <variable name> ;
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of how variables work and are defined,
let us look into some of the variable types that are available to us in C++.
