# Variables

## 2.1 Introduction
Variable are essential to any programming language are variables. In C++, all 
variables are declared in the same format: 

```
<variable type> <variable name> = <variable value> ;
```

This basically tells the compiler the type of the variable, the way we will 
reference the variable, and what the value the variable will have. One can 
leave a variable unitialized like so:

```
<variable type> <variable name> ;
```

Now that we have a basic understanding of how variables work and are defined,
let us look into some of the variable types that are available to us in C++.

## 2.2 Variable Types

There are only a few basic types of variables found in C++.

### The *char* type

The char variable is a character variable, which - as it sounds - can hold a
character. It is declared as follows:

```C++
char var1 = 'a';
```

Please be sure to note the **single quotes** surround the character; this makes
a difference. If we were to instead do the following:

```C++
char var2 = "a";   // Don't do this!
```

The compiler would treat the char variable var2 as a character array (or a *string*),
instead of a single character. To give more information, the compiler will treat var2
as a series of characters, namely, the character 'a' and the null-terminating character,
'\0' (more on this later). 

Character variables also translate into integers, which can be different depending on 
what encoding scheme your machine uses. For most machines, they use a character encoding
scheme known as ASCII.
