# 3. Operators

## 3.1 Introduction

With our understanding of the different types of variables, we now turn as to
how we can manipulate those variables.

## 3.2 Basic Operators

As one might expect, in C++, we are given the four basic arithmetic operations. 
In case you forgot what those operations were, here they are:

1. Addition: Use the "+" operator
2. Subtraction: Use the "-" operator
3. Multiplication: Use the "*" operator
4. Division: Use the "/" operator

Here are some examples of these operators in action:

```C++
int num1 = 1;
int num2 = 1;

int sum = num1 + num2;
int diff = num1 - num2;
int product = num1 * num2;
int quotient = num1 / num2;

cout << sum << " " << diff << " " << product << " " << quotient << endl;
```

This will produce the output:

```
2 0 1 1
```

## 3.3 More on Division

Of all the operators, division exhibits some interesting behaviors depending on the
type of variables performed on. Consider the following situation:

```C++
int num = 10 / 5;
```

It is easy to see what the variable "num" will be equal to here in this situation; it
will hold the value 2. But what happens when we try this piece of code?

```C++
int num1 = 10 / 6;
int num2 = 10 / 7;
```

The result of this operation will actually set "num1" and "num2" equal to 1. Why? 
Since both "num1" and "num2" are of integer types, the fractional portions of both
divisions will be dropped. This also means that 10/6, 10/7, 10/8, 10/9, and 10/10 will 
all yield the value 1, since 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 all go into 10 at most 1 time.
