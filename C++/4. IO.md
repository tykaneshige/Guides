# Input and Output

## 4.1 Introduction

When starting to learn any programming langauge, the first thing most people want to
do is to print something to the screen. It is a huge confidence booster when things
start to appear on your screen (hopefully as you intended). Before we begin trying to 
print anything, the first thing that we will want to do is to include the C++ library
for printing things to the console. This can be done in the following way:

```C++
// Place this at the beginning of your program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

This statement gives you access to the functions that are defined within the C++ 
library "iostream".

## 4.2 Output

After including "iostream", we then are allowed to use the keyword "cout", which 
is short for "console out". We then use the "<<" operator, or the *insertion operator*,
to print the statement the follows it. In case that was confusing, here is an example:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

cout << "Hello World!";     // Prints "Hello World" to the console
```

You can also print variables in the same fashion; just use the name of the variable:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Declare some variables
int num = 5;
char c = 'a';
string word = "Hello World!";               // More on strings later

cout << num;                                // Prints "5"
cout << c;                                  // Prints "a"
cout << word;                               // Prints "Hello World"
```

That's it. It is as simple as that.
