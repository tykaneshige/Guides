# Input and Output

## 4.1 Introduction

When starting to learn any programming langauge, the first thing most people want to
do is to print something to the screen. It is a huge confidence booster when things
start to appear on your screen (hopefully as you intended). Before we begin trying to 
print anything, the first thing that we will want to do is to include the C++ library
for printing things to the console. This can be done in the following way:

```C++
// Place this at the beginning of your program
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

This statement gives you access to the functions that are defined within the C++ 
library "iostream".

## 4.2 Output

After including "iostream", we then are allowed to use the keyword "cout", which 
is short for "console out". We then use the "<<" operator, or the *insertion operator*,
to print the statement the follows it. In case that was confusing, here is an example:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

cout << "Hello World!";     // Prints "Hello World" to the console
```

You can also print variables in the same fashion; just use the name of the variable:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// Declare some variables
int num = 5;
char c = 'a';
string word = "Hello World!";       // More on strings later

cout << num;        // Prints "5"
cout << c;          // Prints "a"
cout << word;       // Prints "Hello World"
```

If you wanted print a series a variables, simply add more insertion operators
Adding spaces between each variable is also as simple as printing a space. If 
you want to add a newline (go to the next line), simply print "endl" (no 
quotations), which is short for "end line". Here is an example:

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int num = 5;
char c = a;

cout << num << c;               // Prints "a5"
cout << num << " " << c;        // Prints "a 5"
cout << num << endl << c;       // Prints "a
                                //         5"
```

That's it. It is as simple as that.

## 4.3 Input

Now that we know how to write output onto the console screen, let us turn to how we
are to read input from the user through the keyboard. To do this, we use the keyword 
"cin", which is short for "console in" and the ">>" operator, or the *extraction operator*. 
Here is an example.

```C++
#include <iostream>
using namspace std;

// Declare some variable to store some input
int numDogs = 0;

// Prompt user for input
cout << "Please enter the numbers of dogs you currently have: ";
cin >> numDogs;

// Print output
cout << "You have " << numDogs << " dogs." << endl;
```

Be aware of the fact that cin will only input up until the first whitespace, which
could be a newline (you press enter), or an actual space. Consider the following 
program that asks for the name of your dog:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string name;

cout << "What is your dog's name?" << endl;
cin >> name;

cout << "Your dog's name is " << name << "." << endl;
```

In the following scenario, the program would work fine:

```
What is your dog's name?
George
Your dog's name is George.
```

But in this scenario, the program would produce an incorrect result:

```
What is your dog's name?
George Washington
Your dog's name is George.
```

Why? Because cin only read up until the first whitespace character, which was 
between the "George" and "Washington". So only "George" was read in, and, in addition,
"Washington" is still an input that has not been read. This can lead to some really
weird results. For example, consider this extension of the previous examples:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string nameDog;
string namePerson;

cout << "What is your dog's name?" << endl;
cin >> name;

cout << "Your dog's name is " << name << "." << endl;

cout << "What's your name?" << endl;
cin >> namePerson;

cout << "Hello " << namePerson << "." << endl;
```

Consider we have a dog named "George Washington" and our name is Joseph. When we run
the above program, this is the result we will get:

```
What is your dog's name?
George Washington
Your dog's name is George.
What's your name?
Hello Washington.
```

As you can see above, we didn't even get a chance to enter our name. That's because
the program read in the name "George" for the first input, and then read in the name
"Washington" for the second input. The name "Washington" was stuck until we tried to
read user input. That is also why the program did not let us input anything; it already
had input from us.

## 4.4 Using **getline**

So what do we do if we want to read in input that may contain spaces? How are we to
read in things like sentences? To do this, we need to include another C++ library, 
the "string" library. As we did with the "iostream" library, we will just need an
additional include statement:

```C++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
```
