# 6. Conditionals

## 6.1 Introduction

In life, we are constantly faced with choices. In the realm of C++, we will also be 
faced with many choices, and we will must be able to code them into binary decisions
that can be evaluated by the computer. This brings us to the idea of using conditionals,
or statements that branch differently depending on conditions in the code.

## 6.2 *if* Statements

The most basic conditional statement you will see in C++ is the *if* statement. An *if*
statment will execute different statements of code depending on the conditions when the
*if* statement is reached. Below is the general form of an *if* statement:

```C++
if (condition == 1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is true
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```

We could also make these conditionals non-binary. We just need to use what is called an
*else-if* statement. It works as follows:

```C++
if (condition == 1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is 1
}
else if (coniditon == 2)
{
    // Code to execute if condition is 2
}
/*
    ...
*/
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition matches none of the numbers
}
```

## 6.3 *switch* Statements

Consider the *else-if* statement we just learned. *else-if* statements are great for 
non-binary decisions. But what if those non-binary decisions consisted of 10 different
options? If we were to just *else-if* statements, it would look something like this:

```C++
if (condition == 1)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 1
}
else if (condition == 2)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 2
}
else if (condition == 3)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 3 
}
else if (condition == 4)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 4 
}
else if (condition == 5)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 5
}
else if (condition == 6)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 6
}
else if (condition == 7)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 7
}
else if (condition == 8)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 8 
}
else if (condition == 9)
{
    // Code to execute if condition equals 9
}
else
{
    // Code to execute if condition does not equal any number
}
```

As you can see, to use *else-if* statements to program a non-binary decision that has
10 options is not very fun to program. So C++ allows us to go about this in a different
way. We can use something called a *switch* statement. Here is a sample of one:

```C++
switch (condition)
{
    case 1: 
    {
        // Code to execute if condition equals 1
    }
    case 2:
    {
        // Code to execute if condition equals 2
    }
    case 3:
    {
        // Code to execute if condition equals 3
    }
    /*
        ...
    */
    case 9:
    {
        // Code to execute if condition equals 9
    }
    default:
    {
        // Code to execute if condition does not equal any number
    }
}
```

Each "case" represents a value that *condition* must be equal to in order for the
switch statement to branch in that direction. "default" is similar to the last "else"
in an *else-if* conditional statement; it's the case where none of the conditions 
before it are met.
