# 6. Loops

## 6.1 Introduction

Let us consider the topic we have just learned: arrays. Suppose I created an array
simply to store a set of items that I just wanted to print later. Well, with the tools
we currently have now, in order to print all the items in an array, we would need to
do something like this:

```C++
// Some array of numbers
int arr[10] = {21, 43, 12, 92, 95, 78, 63, 51, 36. 29};

cout << arr[0] << endl;
cout << arr[1] << endl;
cout << arr[2] << endl;
//...
cout << arr[9] << endl;
```

As you can see, this way of going through an array is very tedious and painful to write.
In addtion, if we did not know how full the array is (we know how big the array is, but 
not how many elements are occupied in it), we would not have a reliable way of going 
through an array.

What if we wanted to do a the same task repeatedly? We would have to do the same thing
there too. And just like going through array, if we the amount of times we needed to do
some set task was not known at compile-time, we would have no reliable way of performing
the repeated tasks correctly.

Both of these problems are solved with *loops*.

## 6.2 *while* Loops

The most basic form of a loop is what is known as a *while* loop. The code contained in 
loop continues to iterate as long as some condition is fulfilled. Here is the basic form
of this type of loop:

```C++
while <some condition>
{
    // Code to be executed on each iteration
}
```

Generally speaking, you might want to have some sort of variable to act as some sort of
indicator or condition to control how long the loop iterates. For example, if I wanted 
to iterate through a loop **num** times, it might look something like this:

```C++
int counter = 0;

while (counter < num)
{
    // Some code statements...
    counter++;
}
```

The loop above will continue to iterate until counter is equal to num. Counter will be
incremented on every iteration of the loop, thus not throwing us into a infinite loop.
