# 6. Loops

## 6.1 Introduction

Let us consider the topic we have just learned: arrays. Suppose I created an array
simply to store a set of items that I just wanted to print later. Well, with the tools
we currently have now, in order to print all the items in an array, I would need to
do something like this:

```C++
// Some array of numbers
int arr[10] = {21, 43, 12, 92, 95, 78, 63, 51, 36. 29};

cout << arr[0] << endl;
cout << arr[1] << endl;
cout << arr[2] << endl;
//...
cout << arr[9] << endl;
```

As you can see, this way of going through an array is very tedious and painful to write.
In addtion, if we did not know how full the array is (we know how big the array is, but 
not how many elements are occupied in it), we would not have a reliable way of going 
through an array.

What if we wanted to do a the same task repeatedly? We would have to do the same thing
there too. And just like going through array, if we the amount of times we needed to do
some set task was not know at compile-time, we would have no reliable way of performing
the repeated tasks correctly.

Both of these problems are solved with *loops*.
