## 8.1 Introduction

Let's go back to the to the topic of variables. As stated in an earlier chapter, when we
create a variable, we give it a name. When we use that variable name, it refers to a 
place in memory where the value for that variable is stored.

Let's do a thought experiment. Let's imagine all the memory in a computer as a long row 
of mailboxes. Each time we declare a new variable, someone claims ownership over a number
of mailboxes, depending on the size of the variable. And if the variable is given a value,
the mailbox is then filled with letters.

If the company handling these mailboxes is competent, then these mailboxes should also 
have addresses associated with them as well. With that, we now have two ways of
identifying a mailbox; we can either use its address, or we can go by whoever owns the
specified mailbox.
