# 9. Functions

## 9.1 Introduction

We've now reached a point in programming where our programs are becoming increasingly 
larger and larger. This also makes your program much more difficult to read and debug. 
There might have also been some times in your experience as a programmer where you 
found yourself copying the same line of code over and over again. As you might have felt, 
this can be very a repetitive and tedious process.

This is where functions come in. C++ functions increase the modularity of your code, thus
making it easier to read and debug.

## 9.2 Declaring and Creating Functions

To begin, let's first look at how to declare a function in C++.

```C++
int someFunction(int num)
{
    int a = num;
    // Insert code statements

    return a;
}
```

Functions have 5 basic components, as shown above.

First is the **return type**. This identifies the type of variable that will be returned 
after the function is called or used. This variable type can range from an int to a bool 
or to a char. However, functions cannot return strings, since strings are not a *primitive*
*data type*. In other words, strings are too complicated for a function to pass back.

Also know that a function may not return a variable. We identify these types of functions by
giving them the return type *void*. 

Second is the **function name**. This is simply the name of your function, and it is the
keyword by which you will be able to call the function.

Third are the **function arguments** or **parameters**. These are values that will be passed
to the function that the function will use when you call it. For example, if you have a
function that adds, you might pass two numbers that the function will add together.

Fourth is the **code body**. This is the set of code statements that the function will execute
when it is called. These statements are no different from normal code statements.

Fifth is the **return statement**. Remember talking about the *return type* earlier? This is 
where we specifically identify what value will be returned from a function. And yes, the 
value stated in the return statement must match the type identified in the function declaration.
