# 9. Functions


## 9.1 Introduction

Imagine you are working at an industrial factory that builds cars. Let's also say that
this factory has embraced the practice of Fordism and thus utilizes the assembly line.
As a worker, that would mean you would not be building an entire car, but a simply a part
of it. For example, all you do in the assembly process is attach the front right tire. 
You never touch any other part of the car other than the front right tire.

If we were to express your job in pseudocode, it would look something like this:

1. Attach front right tire.
2. Apply nuts and bolts.
3. Screw in nuts and bolts until tire is secure.

Simple right? Except there is one problem. This would be pretty awful to write a daily 
production of cars. Of course, we could place this pseudocode in a loop, but what if we
needed to attach the front right tire earlier or later in the assembly process for some
other reason? We would need to rewrite all of the pseudocode in order to attach the 
front right tire in some other place in the assembly line.

Now, this pseudocode is short, but imagine a scenario where we might be dealing with a 
lengthy algorithm in a program. It would be a pain to have to copy and paste all of that
code somewhere else, not to mention that it would make our code unnecessarily long. That's
were functions come into play.
